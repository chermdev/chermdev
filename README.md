# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Charlie

I'm a QA Automation Engineer & Full-Stack Developer passionate about building scalable web applications using **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Prisma**, and **Supabase** â€” all while keeping quality, performance and test automation at the core.

ðŸ’» Recently built and launched:
- [**rifasnl.com**](https://rifasnl.com): A complete raffle tenant site built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **Zustand**, **Resend**, **PostHog**, **Supabase**, **Prisma**, and **Stripe**.  
  Offers a friendly ticket-selling experience with built-in features:  
  âž¤ Shopping cart with bonus handling  
  âž¤ 30-minute reservation timer  
  âž¤ Lucky machine for ticket selection  
  âž¤ Game countdown with automatic order locking to prevent purchases after the raffle ends.
  âž¤ User authentication, order history, and digital delivery via email  
  âž¤ Responsive design, dark mode, and secure payment flows

- [**rifasamigables.com**](https://rifasamigables.com): The **multi-tenant admin platform** where subdomain raffle sites are created and managed.  
  Includes a powerful control panel for raffle owners to:  
  âž¤ Create and manage raffles with multiple editions  
  âž¤ Set up promotions, bonuses and cupons  
  âž¤ Select winners and publish results  
  âž¤ Track performance and customer orders  
  âž¤ Customize branding and editable page content via Markdown  
  Built with **Next.js 15**, **Supabase**, **Prisma**, **Zustand**, and **Stripe**

I love working with tools like **Shadcn/ui**, **Zustand**, **React Query**, **Nuqs**, **Prisma (and exploring Drizzle)** and **Tailwind** to craft delightful user interfaces.  
On the backend, I enjoy using **Prisma**, **Supabase RPCs**, and **PostgreSQL** to keep things fast and maintainable.

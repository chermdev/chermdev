The **multi-tenant admin platform** where subdomain raffle sites are created and managed. Built with **Next.js 15**, **Supabase**, **Prisma**, **Zustand**, and **Stripe**  
Includes a powerful control panel for raffle owners to:

- Create and manage raffles with multiple editions.
- Set up promotions, bonuses and cupons.
- Select winners and publish results.
- Track performance and customer orders.
- Customize branding and editable page content via Markdown.
- Stripe orders management with Stripe Connect

I love working with tools like **Shadcn/ui**, **Zustand**, **React Query**, **Nuqs**, **Prisma (and exploring Drizzle)** and **Tailwind** to craft delightful user interfaces.  
On the backend, I enjoy using **Prisma**, **Supabase RPCs**, and **PostgreSQL** to keep things fast and maintainable.
